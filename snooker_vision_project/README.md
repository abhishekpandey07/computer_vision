# Snooker_Vision_Project
This project uses machine learning and image processing to detect and classify balls on a snooker table using an angled camera.
The corresponding youtube video used for processing can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRvYTfVVSlc.
On linux command:
youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRvYTfVVSlc
can be used to download the video into the current directory.

The coding format makes extensive use of pipelines modules from sklearn. The file work_frame_pipeline.py reads the video file and performs computation and classification.
